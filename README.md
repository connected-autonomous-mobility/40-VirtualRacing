### 1 background

It all started at a parking lot...

A few guys meet there, discussed after a long meetup eving came up with a crazy idea and made it happening. We met at Maker Faire Bay Area 2019 with more guys from Oakland, Ann Arbor, Detroit, Shenzehn, Stuttgart and many more countries. 
Now we're calling us the ***Parking Lot Nerds*** and are heading towards our new venture: Virtual Autonomous Racing.
