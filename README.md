### 1 background

It all started at a parking lot...

A few guys meet there, discussed after a long meetup evening, came up with a crazy idea and made it happening. We met at Maker Faire Bay Area 2019 with more guys from [Oakland](http://diyrobocars.com), [Ann Arbor](https://www.meetup.com/a3vgroup/), [Detroit](https://www.meetup.com/Detroit-Autonomous-Vehicle-Meetup/), [Ottawa](https://www.meetup.com/Ottawa-Autonomous-Vehicle-Group/), [Shenzehn](https://www.roboticsmasters.co/), [Stuttgart](https://www.meetup.com/Connected-Autonomous-Driving) and many more countries. 
Now we're calling us the ***Parking Lot Nerds*** and are heading towards our new venture: Virtual Autonomous Racing. 

Thanks a lot to Ed & Tawn (Oakland), Nic & Paul (Ottawa), Dave (Ann Arbor), Linda & Wallarug (Shenzhen) and especially Alex (Detroit) for literally driving the extra miles down to Stuttgart and making our journey to Silicon Valley / Maker Faire Bay Area 2019 a once in a life time experience.
